    "# Chapter 1 - A Picture of Hydrogen\n",
    "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is the name of the effect we are going to explore and it is used to obtain images, spectra, or time-domain signals of mainly (but not only) hidrogen-based stuff. Images obtained by NMR became so popular that they received their own name: magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, a field of NMR. Some also claim that having the word \"nuclear\" in the name when it was first developed was very unattractive as there was a cold war going on in the decades of 70's and 80's. As we are going to see later, there are other fields that explore the very same idea behind it, with more or less complexity levels, such as Sprectroscopy and Relaxometry. You may also come accross some NMR's cousins such as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). For now, let's not worry about all these names and stick to NMR and its variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the very generic image of a human head obtained by MRI as shown below, I just downloaded it from Pinterest. What we are seeing is essentially the levels of hydrogen in each tissue, which allows us to tell them apart. However, hydrogen does not come alone. It is contained in molecules of different sizes such as water and lipids. NMR allows us many ways to explore how we visualize these levels of hydrogen, making tissues made out of larger molecules appear brighter, for example.\n",

    "The proccess to obtain NMR images may seem extremely complex at first. Here is a super brief summary of what happens\n",
    "1. the subject or sample is magnetized as it enter an enormous magnet\n",
    "2. Next, electromagnetic signals are sent to the subject to select where the imaging will be performed\n",
    "3. One or more electromagnetic pulses of precise intensity and duration are sent to the subject (excitation), altering the baseline state of their hydrogen nuclei\n",
    "4. After the pulses, these nuclei lose energy back to the system (relaxation), which is retrieved by coil-shaped antennas\n",
    "5. The signal captured is digitalized and written as a row of a matrix, which will become the lines of your image \n",
    "6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 with changing the RF a little each time until you have collected a sufficient number of lines (e.g. 512)\n",
    "7. At this point the image is not formed the way we are used to see yet. To do so, perform a 2-D fourier transform on it and the image of the head will be revealed. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does one come up with such idea? They don't. Like most complex things in science, it's a beautiful puzzle where relatively simple pieces of ideas are connected and layered. Thus, a good way to start this journey is by presenting these simple pieces, not losing track of the full image (otherwise we may get bored very easily) and understanding how they are connected. Smile, after all you have a lot of hydrogen in your body!"

    "## 1.1 My head is spinning\n",
    "I was never much of a chemistry guy in high school. I had a hard time understanding atomic properties, electron clouds, molecular bounds - I usually ended up the simple question \"so what?\", to which my professors hardly ever could find me practical insights. In the end, I just swallowed that information like a bitter medicine I had to take to enter college. One of the reasons I chose Electrical Engineering was to get as far as I could from chemistry only to have it knocking on my door again years later when I started my studies in NMR. I realized then that those \"so what?\" concepts were actually the answers to the many new \"but how?\" questions that arised that that topic arose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every non-black pixel (the smallest part of an image) you can see in the head MRI above represents some sort of concentration of hydrogen in that area. Black or near-to-black pixels represents really low hydrogen concentrations, such as the teeth or simply background noise in the air surrounding the subject. Actually, NMR allows us to have such control over hydrogen that the code below shows two images: a bright brain tumor and the same tumor, now darker by chaging some imaging parameters acquisition, which we will explore later. It is not just a matter of level/window (a.k.a brightness/contrast) as you can see for yourself by playing with the image controls if you run the next cell (opens in new window). Differently than X-rays where each tissue is defined by the absorbtion of the radiation, on the images below the tumor is always brighter or darker than its surroundings independently of how you cange the image in post processing. That means that these characteristics are inherent to the image acquisition.\n",
